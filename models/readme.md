### This folder consists of the models used in the Vacsim pipeline used to make the optimal allocation of vaccines. Following models are present in this repository:

**>>ACKTR.py:** This is the RL sub-model (ACKTR) as described in our paper, and contains a self-described RL environment implemented using Open-AI gym coded using Python Language  

**>>DQN.py:**  This is the RL sub-model (DQN) as described in our paper, and contains a self-described RL environment implemented using Open-AI gym coded using Python language  

**>>Contextual Bandit model:** This is the second submodel used in our pipeline for online settings. This is coded using Python language.

**>>SEIR_ModelEvaluation.R:** This is the compartmental model used in our model for finding projections for future date, coded using R language
